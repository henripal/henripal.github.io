<p>
    Bayesian statistics is an incredibly powerful tool for data analysis! I'm currently reading J. Kruschke's
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Bayesian-Analysis-Second-Edition/dp/0124058884">"Doing Bayesian Data Analysis with R"</a>
    and loving it. All the examples in the book are in R, JAGS and STAN, so I decided to take notes
    in a Jupyter notebook using Python and <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc">PyMC</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My notes won't go over <i>all</i> the examples, but I try to explain every step carefully, especially as it pertains to
    Python or PyMC things! If you want a more exhaustive look at all the examples, directly translated in Python, see Osvaldo
    Martin's <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_data_analysis">github repository.</a>
