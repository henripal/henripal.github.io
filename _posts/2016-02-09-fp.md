# Why try functional programming?


``` haskell
Num a => a -> asum' :: [Int] -> IO ()
sum' xs = do
    putStr $ show xs ++ " "
    print $ sum xs

main = do
    sum' [1, 2]
    sum' [1, 2, 3]

    let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    sum' nums
``` 


that is not fun at all

## General functional programming paradigm

import pika

class MessageQueueService(object):
      def log(self, message):

this is not code anymore

\begin{equation}
\int_0^{+\infty} e^x df
\end{equation}

### The usual
The usual       
 
# Clojure, Lisps, and homoiconicity

# Haskell and math

## List comprehension syntax

## Haskell and category theory

### The basics

### An example: the ev exercise

### Application to probability
