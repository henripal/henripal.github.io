title: Why try functional programming? 
---
"Mind-blowing" - that is how I'd most often heard functional programming described before trying it. Now that I have tried it, I absolutely agree. However, the mind-blowing parts are not the first things you learn about a new programming language. That's why I decided to write this teaser post - I'll try to explain in the most straightforward way the parts of Haskell and Clojure that blew my mind, without requiring any background in either:

- code is data, data is code: what is a homoiconic language and why is it so powerful?
- haskell's fascinating type system and how anyone who likes math will feel haskell is the programming language they've been missing their whole life
- more on math and haskell: a little bit of category theory

Note that none of these points are what people will tell you is good about functional programming (concurrency, immutability, etc...) - although these are all very true, my point is to focus on the cool parts rather than the useful parts!

# Code is data: Homoiconicity

## Lisps and Parentheses
Some programming languages are Lisps. This essentially means that their syntax has a lot of parentheses, like so:
``` clojure
(map #(if (even? %) (+ 2 %) (+ 1 (* 3 %))) (range 10))
``` 

All right, that's pretty confusing on a first parse. We'll look at this expression in detail, but I'll tell you what it does right now: it takes an list of numbers from 0 to 10, then performs one iteration of the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) algorithm on each of its elements:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
f(n) =\begin{cases} n/2, & \mbox{if } n\mbox{ is even} \\ 3n+1, & \mbox{if } n\mbox{ is odd} \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}$$

The way Lisp (and Clojure) work is that the parentheses serve to separate *tree nodes*. Each node is of the form `(function expr1 expr2 ...)`, where `expr` can be either data or another tree node. For example, we can represent `(function1 (function2 expr2) expr1)` as:
<div id="mynetwork"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    // create an array with nodes
    var nodes = new vis.DataSet([
        {id: 1, label: 'function1'},
        {id: 2, label: 'function2'},
        {id: 3, label: 'expr1'},
        {id: 4, label: 'expr2'}
    ]);

    // create an array with edges
    var edges = new vis.DataSet([
        {from: 1, to: 2},
        {from: 1, to: 3},
        {from: 1, to: 4}
    ]);

    // create a network
    var container = document.getElementById('mynetwork');

    // provide the data in the vis format
    var data = {
        nodes: nodes,
        edges: edges
    };
    var options = {
        layout:  {
                 hierarchical: {
                 enabled:true }
        }
    };

    // initialize your network!
    var network = new vis.Network(container, data, options);
</script>

## General functional programming paradigm

import pika

class MessageQueueService(object):
      def log(self, message):

this is not code anymore

\begin{equation}
\int_0^{+\infty} e^x df
\end{equation}
