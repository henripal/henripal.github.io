title: Molecular Motors - information flow from the nanoscale to  the microscale 
---

Our lab's interest in non-equiblibrium thermodynamics and particularly in the field
of information thermodynamics (for a review, see the excellent [Thermodynamics
of Information](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v11/n2/full/nphys3230.html)
by Parrondo et al.) naturally led us to think about how we could observe the
exchange of information and energy.

Unfortunately, the order of magnitude at which information plays a part is
$$kT \ln{2}$$, so of the order of $$2 pN.nm$$. Hard to observe. Although some
labs have done this (see the experiments described in the Parrondo review), we
thought about doing something different: use
[microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule) (microscale) on a bed
of [molecular motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin)(nanoscale). We could then
observe the motion of the microtubule and hopefully gain some insight on the
fluctuations of the nanoscale molecular motor. Incidentally, this well known
setup is called a motility assay, and has been used for just about everything
cool you could think about, see for example my PI's
[review](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Ylcj1RUAAAAJ&cstart=20&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=Ylcj1RUAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC).

In the end the setup worked well, and we were able to derive some cool results
about the behavior of the nanoscale motors by looking at the velocity
fluctuations of the microtubules, using a Brownian dynamics simulation. Read
