<p>Using HTML5/JS based frameworks for scientific presentations is a perfect fit. The main advantages over traditional, Powerpoint-based slides are overwhelming: your presentations are instantly web ready. You can use JS to embed interactive simulations to encourage audience participation. You can even create a <a href="http://blog.davila.io/posts/how-to-interactive-vote-driven-presentations-with-revealjs-twilio-and-redis.html">text or email-based real-time poll!</a></p>
<p>After some browsing I used <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">reveal.js</a>, and would highly recommend it. It's easy to use and very flexible. I prepared <a href="/JCoct1/index.html" target="_blank">this presentation</a> using the reveal.js framework in roughly one morning, with basic html and css skills. </p>
