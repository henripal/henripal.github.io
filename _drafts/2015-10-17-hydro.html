excerpt: <p>Why do oil and water separate? A definitive answer to explain this common phenomenon (without which life wouldn't exist!) still has physicists arguing. David Chandler's classic 2005 article provides a widely accepted interpretation. Visualize and play with a simplified 2D interactive simulation to gain a better understanding of the hydrophobic effect!  </p>

  <p>Although the hydrophobic effect (separation of oil and water!) has been well established experimentally for decades, its microscopic origins have been the subject of much controversy: entropy? hydrogen bonds? or a mix of both? David Chandler's classic 2005 paper is widely accepted as the final word in the hydrophobic debate.  </p>
