Hi, my name is Henri Palacci. I'm a software engineer and machine learning scientist. I'm currently most interested in the scientific, technical, and cultural challenges at the intersection of the life sciences and applied machine learning. 

I'm currently working on something new.

I was previously VP of ML and head of engineering at [Anagenex](https://www.anagenex.com/), 

I am a recent PhD graduate from the Biomedical Engineering department at Columbia University, in the [Hess laboratory for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/hess/).

My research was focused on the application of non-equilibrium statistical physics to [statistical learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02855) or systems such as [self-assembling enzyme structures](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2905) or [motor proteins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WAmP2uQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WAmP2uQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC). 

I am now working on a startup at the intersection of machine learning and
biomedical engineering.

Previously, I earned a degree in applied mathematics from [ecole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique), in statistics from [ensae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSAE_ParisTech), then spent ten years trading [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_CDO) and managing a [trading team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank) at [societe generale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale).
