Hi, I'm Henri Palacci. I'm a machine learning scientist and software engineer, interested in the cultural, technical, and scientific challenges at the intersectio of life sciences and machine learning.

I'm currently working on something new.

I was previously 
- VP of ML and head of engineering at [Anagenex](https://www.anagenex.com/)
- -ML researcher at [D.E Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)
- PhD student rom the Biomedical Engineering department at Columbia University, in the [Hess laboratory for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/hess/).


Before grad school, I earned a degree in applied mathematics from [ecole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique), in statistics from [ensae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSAE_ParisTech), then spent ten years trading [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_CDO) and managing a [trading team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank) at [societe generale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale).
