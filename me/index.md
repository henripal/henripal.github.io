Hi, my name is Henri Palacci. I am a recent PhD graduate from the Biomedical Engineering department at Columbia University, in the [Hess laboratory for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/hess/).

My research was focused on the application of non-equilibrium statistical physics to [statistical learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02855) or systems such as or [self-assembling enzyme structures](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2905) or [motor proteins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WAmP2uQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WAmP2uQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC). 

I am now working on a startup at the intersection of machine learning and
biomedical engineering.

Previously, I earned a degree in applied mathematics from [ecole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique), in statistics from [ensae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSAE_ParisTech), then spent ten years trading [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_CDO) and managing a [trading team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank) at [societe generale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale).
