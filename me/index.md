Hi, my name is Henri Palacci. I am a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering department at Columbia University, in the [Hess laboratory for nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/hess/).

I am interested in applying statistical physics to non-equilibrium systems such as [motor proteins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WAmP2uQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WAmP2uQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) or [self-assembling enzyme structures](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6274/733).

I am now exploring the links between information theory, statistical learning, and non-equiblibrium statistical physics.

Previously, I earned a degree in applied mathematics from [ecole polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique), in statistics from [ensae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSAE_ParisTech), then spent ten years trading [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_CDO) and managing a [trading team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_bank) at [societe generale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale).
